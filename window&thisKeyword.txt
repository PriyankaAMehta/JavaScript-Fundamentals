1.  Which is the shortest program in JS ?
    Empty file is the shortest program in JS.

2.  Why is an empty file considered the shortest JavaScript program?

    1.  Even when a JavaScript file is completely empty, the JavaScript engine still performs the following steps:
        Creation of the Global Execution Context (GEC)

    2.  When a JavaScript file is loaded, the JavaScript engine automatically creates a Global Execution Context.
        Memory space is allocated.

            1. The execution phase is prepared.

            2. Even though there is no code to execute, the engine still creates this context.

            3. Global Scope is Created

    3.  If you open Developer Tools → Sources, select the JavaScript file, and place a debugger statement (or pause execution), you will see a Global scope created under the Scope panel—even for an empty file.

    4.  Creation of the window Object and this Keyword
        Along with the Global Execution Context, the JavaScript engine automatically creates:

        1. The window object : window is an object with lot of functions and methods. window object can be accessed anywhere in the program.

        2. The this keyword

    5.  Accessing window and this in the

        Typing window in the console returns the global window object.
        Typing this in the global scope also returns the window object.

    6.  Relationship Between this and window
        In the global execution context (in browsers), the this keyword refers to the window object.

    7.  Whenever the JS code is executed, window object is the global object created by JS engine along with global execution context and also this is created.

3.  Global Object in case of browser is known as window and this keyword points to the global object window.

    1. In case of node the global object is known as something else but whenever the JS code is executed , there will global execution context and global object created.

    2. The JavaScript is not only run on browsers, it is also run on servers, and lot of devices and places.

    3. Wherever the JS is running , there must a JS engine.

       1. For example : The JavaScript engine chrome is V8
          The JavaScript engine Mozilla Firefox is SpiderMonkey.
          The JavaScript engine for Apple Safari is JavaScriptCore (also called Nitro).

    4. At the global level this is equal to window. so when you type this === window on console , it return true.
