1.  JavaScript Execution Context

    1. Everything in JavaScript happens inside the execution context.
    2. Every browser has its own JavaScript Engine.
    3. Execution context in the JavaScript engine is a place where whole JS code is executed.
    4. Execution context is like a container.
    5. This execution context has : Memory component and Code component.

2.  Memory Component

    1. Memeory Component is the place where variables and functions are stored in key value pair.
    2. for example a:10 , fn:{}
    3. Memeory component is also called as variable enviornment

3.  Code Component

    1. Code component is the place where the code is executed.
    2. Code component is also called as Thread of Execution.
    3. Here the code is executed 1 line at a time.

4.  JavaScript is Synchrounous Single Threaded Language.
    1️⃣ Single-threaded
    Single-threaded means JavaScript can execute only one task at a time on its main thread.
    JavaScript has a single call stack, so it processes one operation before moving to another.
    JavaScript executes 1 command at a time.

    2️⃣ Synchronous
    Synchronous means JavaScript executes code line by line, in specific order.
    Each statement or command must finish executing before the next statement starts.

    Combined meaning (important)
    Because JavaScript is single-threaded and synchronous, it executes one operation at a time and moves to the next operation only after the current one completes.

5.  Whenever we run or executes a JS code, execution context is created.

6.  Example of working of execution context:

                 var n = 2;
                 function square (num){
                 var ans = num * num;
                 return ans;
                 }
                 var square2 = square(n);
                 var square4 = square(4);

                 OUTPUT :
                    4
                    16

        1. when the above code is executed or run, the global execution context is created behind the scenes.
        2. The execution context has memory component and code component
        3. The execution context is created into 2 phases : 1. Memory Creation Phase and 2. Code Execution phase

        4. MEMORY CREATION PHASE

           1. In this phase JS allocates the memory to all variables and functions.
           2. As soon as JS starts to run , It skims through the whole programme and starts to allocate the memory to variables and functions
           3. variables and functions are stored in the key:value pair.
           4. so when JS Skims through the above code, and as soon as the JS reads the
                1. First Line : var n = 2; It allocates memory for variable n
                        as n : undefined
                        SO IN THE FIRST PHASE IT STORES SPECIAL VALUE CALLED UNDEFINED FOR ALL THE VARIABLES
                2. When the JS encounters the second line and sees its a function :

                function square (num){
                 var ans = num * num;
                 return ans;
                 }

                 it stores the whole function as square:(num){var ans = num * num;return ans;}
            5. Now the pointer is at line 6 i.e var square2 = square(n);
                1. so its a variable it stores as square : undefined
            6. Now the pointer is at line 7 i.e var square4 = square(4);
                1. so its a variable and it stores it as square4 : undefined
            7. So in the first phase i.e memory creation phase, JS Engine skims through the whole program and allocates memory to variables and functions.

        5. CODE EXECUTION PHASE

            1. The JS engine runs through the whole program from the line 1 and starts executing the code line by line.
            2. The line 1 : var n = 2.
                    Now the value 2 is placed in the place of undefined. so now the value 2 is assigned.
                    now it becomes n : 2

    An Execution Context is an internal environment where JavaScript:
    Keeps track of variables
    Handles function execution
    Manages the call stack
