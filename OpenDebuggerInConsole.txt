1.  How to Run the Debugger in Chrome DevTools (Sources Tab)

    1. 1️⃣ Open Chrome DevTools
       Open your webpage in Google Chrome
       Right-click anywhere on the page → Inspect


        Or use shortcuts:
        Windows / Linux: Ctrl + Shift + I
        Mac: Cmd + Option + I

    2.  2️⃣ Go to the Sources Tab
        In DevTools, click Sources
        This tab shows all loaded files (HTML, CSS, JS)

    3.      3️⃣ Click on Your JavaScript File

        In the left panel:
        Expand Page → your-file.js
        Or Snippets if you’re using a snippet
        Click the JavaScript file you want to debug

    4.          4️⃣ Set a Breakpoint (Manual Way)
            Click on the line number where you want execution to pause
            A blue marker appears → breakpoint is set
            Example:
            console.log(x); // click line number here

    5.          5️⃣ Reload or Trigger the Code
            Reload the page (Ctrl + R / Cmd + R)
            Or trigger the event (button click, API call, etc.)
            Execution will pause at the breakpoint

    6.             ▶️ Running the Debugger Controls
                Once paused, use the toolbar on the right:

                Button	Action

                        ▶️ Resume	Continue execution
                        ⤼ Step over	Execute next line
                        ⤽ Step into	Go inside a function
                        ⤴ Step out	Exit current function
                        ⏸ Pause	Pause execution

    7.           6️⃣ Inspect Variables on the right
                While paused:
                Scope panel → view local, global, and closure variables
                Watch panel → add expressions to monitor
                Console → type variable names and expressions live

    8.              7️⃣ Using the debugger Keyword (Code Way)
                You can pause execution directly from code:
                var x = 10;
                debugger;
                console.log(x);
                When DevTools is open, execution automatically pauses at debugger.
