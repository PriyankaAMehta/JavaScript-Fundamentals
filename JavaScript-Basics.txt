1. Where Do you write the JS code?

   1. In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.
   2. Old JavaScript examples may use a type attribute: <script type="text/javascript">.
      The type attribute is not required. JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML.
   3. you can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
      Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.

2. JS Comments
   // - single line comments
