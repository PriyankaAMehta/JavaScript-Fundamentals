1.  Where Do you write the JS code?

    1. In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.
    2. Old JavaScript examples may use a type attribute: <script type="text/javascript">.
       The type attribute is not required. JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML.
    3. you can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
       Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.

2.  JS Comments
    // - single line comments
    /_...._/ - multi line comments

3.  Variables in JS

    1.  JavaScript variables are containers for data.

    2.  JavaScript variables can be declared in following ways :

            1. Modern JavaScript
                    Using let
                    Using const

            2. Older JavaScript
            Using var (Not Recommended)
            Automatically (Not Recommended)

    3.  JavaScript Identifiers :

                1. Variables are identified with unique names called identifiers.

                2. Names can be short like x, y, z.

                3. Names can be descriptive age, sum, carName.

                4. The rules for constructing names (identifiers) are:

                        1. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
                        2. Names must begin with a letter, a $ sign or an underscore (_).
                        3. Names are case sensitive (X is different from x).
                        4. Reserved words (JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

    4.  let keyword :

            1. The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

            2. Variables declared with let have Block Scope

            3. Variables declared with let must be Declared before use

            4. Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope

    5.  const keyword :

            1. The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

            2. Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared

            3. Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned

            4. Variables defined with const have Block Scope

4.  JavaScript has 8 Datatypes :

        1. String: 	A text of characters enclosed in quotes

        2. Number:	A number representing a mathematical value

        3. Bigint:	A number representing a large integer

        4. Boolean:	A data type representing true or false

        5. Object:	A collection of key-value pairs of data

        6. Undefined:	A primitive variable with no assigned value

        7. Null:	A primitive value representing object absence

        8. Symbol:	A unique and primitive identifier

5.  Functions

    1.  What are functions in JS
        Functions in JS are like minii programs. Functions are reusable block of code designed to perform a particular task.

    2.  JavaScript Function Syntax

                    function name( p1, p2, ... ) {
                    // code to be executed
                    }

                    1. The function name follows the naming rules for variables.

                    2. Optional parameters are listed inside parentheses: ( p1, p2, ... )

                    3. Code to be executed is listed inside curly brackets: { }

    3.  Function Invocation ()

                    1.The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

                    2. When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code

                    3. When an event occurs (a user clicks a button)

                    4. Automatically (self invoked)

                    5. The () operator invokes a the function.
